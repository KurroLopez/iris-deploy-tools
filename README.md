### The idea
The aim of this tool is to provide the developer with the possibility of deploying their productions in an automated way and without the need to manually create the components and configurations from the management portal.

### Prerequisites
Make sure you have [git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git "git") installed.

### Installation
- Clone/git pull the repo into any local directory 
```
git clone https://github.com/KurroLopez/Salutic.Tools.git .\Salutic.Tools
```
- Install the classes in a namespace that can be shared, for example USER
- Confirm that this namespace has access to the Ensemble libraries (Ens.*)
- Create the namespace that you want to deploy or improve.
- Do the library mapping, in this case with USER, and share the Salutic.Tools classes
